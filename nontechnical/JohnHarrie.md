evolveToken NonTechnical people. 
There are 20+ people Coworking at the Grand Forks S Wash Starbucks. 
There are not many Coworking at The 701 Coworking by evolveGF.
Why?
(contributions will be noted in github)
--For example I think people are willing to pay a higher one time price for a product and service with perceived high value. 
VS a monthly subscription.

Culture. 
Starbucks portrays success. 
Not that 701 doesn't, but Starbucks has top of mind awareness. 
It also provides people-watching entertainment. 
I think people feel that they can't just go hang at the 701 without an event or invitation. 
If 701 sold coffee, naybe people would feel they can hang there because they paid the price of admission

Dan S - so if an app let you know that certain people are at the 701 or planning to be there it may help?
if an app intelligently figured out there was low utilization one day and offered an incentive to drop in

JH-
Possibly. I think people need to have a reason to go there without feeling they are free-loading. IMHO
TThe problem is it's tough not to feel like you are intruding on people's privacy because several people are working out of there.
