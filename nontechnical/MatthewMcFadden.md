There are 20+ people Coworking at the Grand Forks S Wash Starbucks. 
There are not many Coworking at The 701 Coworking by evolveGF. 
Why? (contributions will be noted in github) 
--For example I think people are willing to pay a higher one time price for a product and service with perceived high value. 
VS a monthly subscription.

MF-
So I work from 701 and have since August 2017. 
Coffee is included in your monthly rent. 
I think it is more a lazy / shyness factor that more people don't check out 701. 
I even share an Atari 2600 setup and an Oculus RIFT VR setup for everyone to play / try. 
Everyone is welcome in my opinion. 
What I have seen is that people need to attend / work on a more regular basis from there so that the "get to know others" 
factor becomes easier. 
When it does, people interact on a social level which then can turn into coworking type activities. 
Same sort of thing when you go to work @ a new company. 
Gotta get the feel / lay of the land before you are comfortable with other folks. 
Think it is just human nature. 
Also let me clarify when I say lazy, I mean folks don't look very far into what the 701 space is all about, 
have preconceptions which they act upon meaning not even try it or see what its about.
